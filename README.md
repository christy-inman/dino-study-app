# dino-study-app
CLI app meant to give a basic introduction to a small group of the most popular dinosaurs!  Intended to be a study resource that adds a little bit of interactivity to the sometimes static experience that traditional study guides offer.


Install Instructions:

1) In your browser go to https://code.visualstudio.com/ to download the text editor. Make sure the editor is in your application folder to ensure access to it. We used VSCode but any code text editor should work. If you have one already then just move on to step two.

2) Open your terminal, most operating systems have one, if you don't find one download Zsh or another popular terminal alternative.

3) While in your terminal run
```ruby -v```
to check for the version of Ruby on your computer. If it's older than 2.0, or you don't have Ruby installed, go to https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ to install a newer version.

4) Create or log in to your GitHub profile.

5) Fork and clone our repository onto your local environment.

6) Once cloned onto your machine open the environment.rb file and ensure that CLI.welcome is the last line in the file. This needs to be uncommented to properly run the program.

7) At this point go back to your terminal and ensure you are in the dino_study_app directory. Then run
```ruby config/environment.rb```
. This should start the app and get you going on your dino studies!


Contributors Guide:

1) If you would like to contribute to this application ensure you've followed steps 1-5 of the install instructions.

2) At this point you can create your own branch and begin adding to the project. We manually seeded our dinosaur database so if you'd like to add more dinosaurs please add them in the seed.rb file and ensure that you create each dinosaur following the same format.

3) Make sure to write clear and concise commit messages so your proposed additions/fixes are easy to understand.

4) Create a new pull request to GitHub when you're ready to have your code reviewed.

5) Respond to any code review feedback.


Dino Data Source:

We are very grateful for the people at https://www.fossils-facts-and-finds.com/ for providing the information that we used to seed our dino database. There is a lot more information on dinosaurs and fossils on the website, so if this app ignited your interest in dinosaurs have their page be your first stop on expanding your dino knowledge!


The creators of this CLI application are currently students in the Flatiron School Immersive Software Engineering program. This was our first project and we hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed creating it!



While our project is not yet licensed please respect our creative integrity and don't pass it off as your own.
