    height: "30 feet",
    weight: "2-3 tons", 
    location: "Western North America",
    time_period: "Late Jurassic Period",
    fact: "Allosaurus had between 14 and 17 teeth on both the top 
        and bottom jaws. The teeth were replaced continually: as a tooth 
        feel out, a new one grew in its place."

    time_period: "Late Cretaceous Period", 
    fact: "Ankylosaurus had a huge club on the end of its tail. 
        This was very handy in combat, and to protect against enemies. 
        It was composed of two large osteoderms, with a row of small 
        osteoderms at the midline, and two small osteoderms at the tip."

    location: "Western Europe", 
    time_period: "Late Jurassic Period", 
    fact: "Archaeopteryx had features of both a dinosaur and a bird. 
        It had feathers, which is a feature of birds, but it also had 
        teeth, a bony tail,  and limbs that more closely resembled those 
        of dinosaurs."

        30 feet in the air."

    location: "Mongolia", 
    time_period: "Late Cretaceous Period", 
    fact: "Conchoraptor did not have teeth, but a strong beak, 
        possibly to feed on mollusks by crushing their shells to get 
        the soft meat inside."

    fact: "It ate plants with a toothless duck-like bill. 
        Some fossils have been found with the contents of their 
        stomach still there! The meal included conifer needles, fruits, 
        seeds, and twigs."

    weight: "170-200 pounds", 
    location: "Western North America", 
    time_period: "Late Jurassic Period", 
    fact: "It’s unique strong tail was used to help the large 
        animal maintain balance, which probably proved pretty useful 
        when changing directions while running. Dryosaurus relied on its 
        speed as a main defense against carnivorous dinosaurs."

    weight: "45 pounds", 
    location: "Mongolia and China", 
    time_period: "Late Cretaceous Period", 
    fact: "Oviraptor had a uniquely shaped jaw bone, where the bone 
        actually extended below the jaw line and would have pushed into 
        the space between the toothless lower jaws. This made it easier 
        to use force to open tough shells."

    fact: "Pachycephalosaurus, or 'thick headed lizard', had a 
        10-inch thick bony mass on the top of its head, that it 
        regularly used for head butting matches. Pachycephalosaurus’ 
        were thought to have lived in packs or herds, similar to mountain 
        goats. This would have made head butting much easier, due to the 
        close proximity of others."

    time_period: "Late Cretaceous Period", 
    fact: "Scientists aren't quite sure what the purpose of this was, 
        but it has been hypothesized that the prominent crest on its 
        head, which was a long curved hollow tube-like structure 
        protruding from the nose upwards and back from the skull, 
        might have been used as a communication system. The dinosaur 
        would blow through its nose and the sound would come out 
        through the crest."

    fact: "Spinosaurus had large spines that extended from the 
        vertebrae along its back, and could be up to six feet long. 
        It is commonly thought that these spines were covered by a 
        membrane of skin to form a sail like fin."

    time_period: "Late Jurassic Period", 
    fact: "Stegosaurus had plates of hardened skin, called scutts, 
        the dinosaur used as armor. These plates were about 2 feet

    time_period: "Late Cretaceous Period", 
    fact: "The first fossil of mostly intact triceratops skull was 
        found in 1887 in Denver, Colorado. Some say the horns were 
        for attracting mates or showing dominance, similar to antlers 
        of a deer or horns of a mountain goat."
